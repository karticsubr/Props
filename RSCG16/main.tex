\hdg{Natural habitats and urbanisation}

\hdg{Monitoring population distributions}
Imagine possessing the capability to hypothesise, in real-time, dynamic spatial population densities of queried species of animals. This would be an invaluable tool for conservationists battling to mitigate human-wildlife conflict, striving to target anti-poaching measures, toiling to drive policies on urbanisation and protection of wild habitats, etc. I want to drive a pilot project making initial steps towards the development of such capability. In this pilot project I shall focus on crossmodal regression to analyse the spatio-temporal distributions of two behaviourally different species --- elephants and leopards --- in the reserved forests of Karnataka (my home state) in Southern India.


\hdg{Timeliness}
The stupendous rate of development of information technology in Bangalore, the capital of Karnataka, has fostered the development of a number of creative technologies towards application in conservation. Forest rangers were issued mobile phones equipped with specially developed applications such as 'Huli' or 'Hejje' (by Sidvin Core-Tech and KeyFalcon Solutions) to facilitate the reporting of animal sightings while the applications automatically performed spatio-temporal tagging. Digital camera traps donated by companies such as CSS Corp became prevalent (about one per 4 sq.km) in the protected forests in Karnataka. While these developments were useful by introducing innovative measurement devices, there is an imminent need for archiving, scientifically-sound analysis and exploitation of the data from such sources. A notably different solution, adopted by WildSeve~\cite{}, provides a technological platform, along with a toll-free phone number, for farmers to report wildlife conflict incidents. WildSeve was jointly supported by The Rufford Foundation, National Geographic's Big Cats Initiative and Oracle Giving.

\hdg{Sources of tracking data}
The main sources of data are radio-collars, camera-traps and forest rangers via smartphone applications. 
Transmitters (radio-collars) are useful means of tracking individuals within a species when the population is small or when the species exhibits clumped (herding) social behaviour.~e.~g.~herds of elephant. However, in regions with thriving populations of animals that pose a threat to human life, such as big cats or lone tuskers, tracking based on a few statistical samples is unacceptable due to dangerously high uncertainty. Further, while tracking using radio-collars is useful for monitoring the individual's health and habits, predicting when they run the risk of human-conflict is non-trivial since it requires active seeking (polling) using a receiver. 
% 
Automatically triggered camera-traps can detect individual animals at pre-determined spatial locations where the cameras are installed. One potential problem with camera-traps is determining where to install them: if their installation is too close to human settlement, there is insufficient time to react to a detected threat; if they are installed away from human settlements, the number of false alarms are high. However, their non-invasive sensing capability together with flexibility for coupling with sophisticated software --- such as pattern recognition modules for recognition of species as well as particular individuals (unique striped patterns on tigers) --- make them a valuable form of sensing.
% 
A more recent form of tracking has been via the use of smartphones with custom-designed applications such as 'Hejje' (\textit{transl.} pug-mark) for reporting events such as animal sightings, water levels, illegal deforestation, etc. Scores of such phones have been distributed to forest rangers who patrol thousands of kilometres of forest tracks in a month. 


\hdg{The mathematical crux} The central problem involves non-linear regression of a non-stationary spatio-temporal function with variable uncertainty in the position (domain) of the measurements as well as in the measured values (range). For example, camera traps are precise in spatio-temporal localisation while rangers using smartphones might report more sightings per day. 

\hdg{Hypothesis}
duality between uncertainty in position and uncertainty in value.
regression modelled by a gaussian process with a non-stationary covariance function.

\hdg{Experimental methods and timeline}
Simulation: uncertainty.
Real data: Camera traps and Hejje
Additional sensors: Microphones with solar-powered FPGA call-detectors.

\hdg{Foundation for future projects}
Combine with data about water levels, urbanisation, foliage, etc. Build simulation models for fauna.
